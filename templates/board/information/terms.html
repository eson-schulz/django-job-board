                  indicates your acceptance of these terms.</p>

              <p>1.2 Eson LLC reserves the right, in its discretion, to change or modify all or any part of this

                  cease all use of the Service.</p>

                  between the terms of this Agreement and any additional terms and conditions posted on the Service,

                  to preserve, to the maximum extent possible, the intent of the parties, (ii) the validity, legality
                  and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby,
                  and (iii) such decision shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision
                  under other circumstances</p>
